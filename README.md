# Clone Of Patika

I am developing a desktop application with Java and MySQL using Java Swing. I am developing this project as homework to put everything I have learned into Patika.Dev's Java 102 course into practice.

In this project, I aimed to make a desktop application that was inspired by Patika.Dev. There will be users, either operators, educators, or students. Educators will give lessons, and students will take lessons. The operator will assist with the application. CRUD operations are included.
